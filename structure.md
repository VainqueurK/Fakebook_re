### Login Screen
When the user initially opens the app if the first screen they encounter is the login screen.
Here they can enter in the their email and password in order to login.
If the user wants to create a new account or do not already have an account they can click the 
***'Dont't have account? Sign Up'*** which will bring the user to the Register Page

### Register Screen ###
On this screen the user can enter in the details necessary to create thier account i.e.
Username, Full Name, Date of Birth, Email and Password. The user can then register by clicking the register 
button. If there is an issue with the details entered the account will not be created via clicking register but instead 
be promted as to where the issue was e.g email already in use. The user can then correct thsese details and click register again. 

## Home Screen ##
The user is first brought to the home page. If the user hits the orange arrow button they can type a post. 
This feature could not be fully implemented.
The most important feature of this tab is searchin gfor users. This is accomplihed by clicking the search icon on the top right of the screen. On some phones this icon is moved to much to the side and can be hard to click, but it still can be clicked.
when cliked all users show up. You can then search for a specific user. Then clik on the user and you are brought to their profile screen. 

## Other Users Profile Screen ##
On this screen you can connect to the user by cliking the connect button on the top right. You will get a success message.
You can see information about the user on this screen.

## Connections Screen 
This screen will be blank until you make connections. When you have connections they will all show up and you can search them via the search bar. When you select a connection you will be brought to that connections profile page. 


## Profile Screen ### 
The profile and edit profile screen performed perfectly  [at this point](https://github.com/JamesBrosnan1903/FakebookOne/commit/ac46b06d180fac45a3262f9352da17f566b33667)
The submitted version crashes due to changes which were made to the overall structure of the app later on which failed. 
The correctly working version linked to above, diplays all profile information and the profile picture which for every new account is initially a placeholder image. There is also a logout button which logs the user out. The user can also click on the edit profile button to go to the edit profile screen.

## Edit Profile
In this screen the user can chnage their profile picture and add/ edit information e.g. eduction , job etc and then save their changes. This only works in the above mentioned verion but not in the final version. To see what it is like you should pull the ocde from the point of that commit and run the app then.

## Message User Screen
This screen is the tab icon which is first to the left. Its implementation failed and should have been deleted. Do not concern yourself with this page.
